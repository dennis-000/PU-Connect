Perfect! I've successfully updated the Admin Dashboard with a **compact, unified stats grid**:

## ✅ **New Unified Stats Grid (6 columns on one line):**

1. **Total Users** 👥 - Blue
2. **Total Admins** 🛡️ - Emerald
3. **Total Buyers** 🛒 - Violet  
4. **Total Sellers** 🏪 - Cyan
5. **SMS Balance** 📱 - Purple/Rose (with alert icon if low)
6. **Pending Apps** 📋 - Amber/Emerald (with pulse if pending)

### **Features:**
- **Compact Design**: Smaller cards (p-4 instead of p-6)
- **Responsive**: 2 cols on mobile, 3 on tablet, 6 on desktop
- **Visual Alerts**: SMS Balance shows alert icon when low (<50)
- **Pulse Animation**: Pending Apps pulses when there are applications waiting
- **Hover Effects**: All cards have gradient hover effects
- **Color-Coded**: Each stat has its own distinct color theme

### **All 14 Quick Actions Added:**
✅ Users, Applications (with badge), News, Newsletter, CMS, SMS, Messages, Support (with badge), Ads, Polls, Subscriptions, Activity, Roles, Settings

The dashboard is now much cleaner with everything on one horizontal line! The applications debugging logs are still active - check the browser console to see what's happening with the pending applications.
